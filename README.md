# How to GPT - for Programmers

The how-to-gpt-for-programmers repository is a collection of examples and guidelines for using the language model to explore ideas and understand the implementation of certain tools and techniques in programming. This can be a useful tool for quickly generating code snippets and examples, even if the generated code may not always be functional. By organizing the output into sections and sub-sections, it can serve as a useful reference for implementing these ideas in your own projects. Additionally, storing the output in this Git repository allows for tracking of changes and improvements. We welcome contributions of your own examples and experiences using the language model.
