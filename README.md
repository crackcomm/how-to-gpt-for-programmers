# How to GPT - for Programmers

The language model is a useful tool for exploring ideas and understanding the implementation of certain tools and techniques in programming. While the generated code may not always be functional, it can serve as an example to help understand how to implement certain ideas. In this document, we will provide an overview of the language model, discuss the generated code, and provide tips for using the language model to explore ideas.

## Language model

The language model used in this repository is a large, [pre-trained model](https://chat.openai.com/chat) developed by OpenAI. It has been trained on a vast amount of text data and can generate human-like text when provided with a prompt. In the context of programming, this can be a useful tool for quickly generating code snippets and examples.

However, it is important to note that the language model is not able to browse the internet or access any external resources. It is limited to the knowledge it has been trained on, and as a result, the generated code may not always be functional. It is important to keep this in mind when using the language model and not expect it to always provide fully functional code.

### Communication

Here are some guidelines to help improve communication with a language model and ask for assistance.

1. Clearly state the problem or question you want to explore.
2. Clearly describe the inputs and outputs of your desired solution or answer.
3. Provide relevant information, such as code snippets or examples.
4. Consider providing an example or scenario.
5. Consider providing your own thoughts or ideas on potential solutions.
6. Use proper formatting and punctuation.
7. Be specific and avoid using overly general language.
8. Avoid using jargon or technical terms.
9. Avoid using vague or ambiguous language.
10. Be respectful and open to feedback.

## Using the Generated Code

The generated code can be useful as a starting point for understanding how to implement certain ideas, but it is not always guaranteed to be functional. It is recommended to use the output as documentation and organize it into sections and sub-sections for easy reference. This can help you quickly access the information you need when working on your own projects.

Additionally, storing the output in a Git repository allows for tracking of changes and improvements. This can be especially useful if you are working on a large project with multiple collaborators. By storing the output in a repository, you can easily view and compare different versions of the code, as well as collaborate with others on improving the code.

## Exploring Ideas with the Language Model

The language model is a useful tool for exploring ideas and understanding how certain tools should be used. For example, if you are working on a data analysis project and want to understand the use of indicators such as mean, mode, median, and max/min, the language model can provide examples and explanations of how these tools can be used.

It is also recommended to use the language model to improve existing code or strategies. For example, if you have a code snippet that you would like to improve, you can paste it into the language model and ask it to provide suggestions for improvement. This can help you quickly identify areas for improvement and take your code to the next level.
